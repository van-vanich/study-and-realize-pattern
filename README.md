# study-and-realize-pattern
In this project, I realize all the classic patterns in java. 
For the study, I use these websites:
- https://refactoring.guru/
- https://howtodoinjava.com/gang-of-four-java-design-patterns/

At the moment, I realize:
- singleton
- prototype
- builder
- factory
- abstract factory
- adapter
- bridge
- composite
- decorator
