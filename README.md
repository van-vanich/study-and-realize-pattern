# study-and-realize-pattern
In this project, I realize all the classic patterns in java. 
For the study, I use these websites:
- https://refactoring.guru/
- https://howtodoinjava.com/gang-of-four-java-design-patterns/

I realize:
- creational design patterns: 
  - singleton
  - prototype
  - builder
  - factory
  - abstract factory
 
- structural design patterns
  - adapter
  - bridge
  - composite
  - decorator
  - facade
  - flyweight
  - proxy
 
- behavioral design patterns
  - Chain of Responsibility
  - command
  - iterator
  - controller(mediator)
  - memento
  - observer
  - state
  - strategy
  - template method
  - visitor
